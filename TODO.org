CLOSED: [2025-12-29 Mon 22:58]
** TODO write a function to normalize a typst link based on the target platform
- if target == "pdf" then pretty much change the extension from .typ to .pdf and add file://
- if target == "url" then pretty much remove the extension
** TODO Write a WASM plugin that normalizes Typst links 
- Typst-compile time:
  - take the omnilinks and try to get the ~To~ part (id, file title etc.)
  - add a #metadata for each link
  - omni cli is gonna later on pick up all metadata from typst query to *gather* the links

** TODO figure out how to use heading part in wasm pklugin
** TODO Pdf links?
pdf is a bit fussy about links.
while in html we can just use a / and it will be a "relative" link, 
in PDF we (theoretically) need a full URL.
AND it looks like firefox doesn't even like ~file://~ urls.
we could solve this by:
- force users to have a omni_machine.toml file with machine specific settings (to be gitignored)
- the file contains the prepend URL for all links.
- each node has a SINGLE url associated with it.
- with ~?format=pdf~ we can see a PDF embedded inside the website for easy navigation.

it's a bit of a dirty solution but ay that's what you have to do
* Thinking
** DONE define a config file "omni.toml" that counts as project root
CLOSED: [2025-12-26 Fri 17:09]
keys:
- project name
- directory aliases
- (user) nodes_path = nodes.toml
- db_path = db.csv (??)
  (db.csv is the ultimate source of truth for linking.)
    * DONE choose a database format (csv, toml, json...)
CLOSED: [2025-12-26 Fri 17:10]
settled on toml
** DONE what do we even want to store in the db?
CLOSED: [2025-12-27 Sat 03:14]
+ i'm in a directory called ~notes~
+ ~omni new "My Note.typ"~
+ recognize format ~.typ~. go get the template and everything...
+ creates file ~notes/My Note.typ~
+ database gets a new entry with an ~id~ as key:
  + filename (which may later change!)
  + aliases (should aliases be here? maybe useful for typsting..)
    + one of these aliases is the slug: ~my-note~
  + other metadata such as format, kind of LOCATION (note, directory, heading in other note..)
    
#+BEGIN_SRC typst
@omni.matrix:operations.addition // to full heading path slug [[omni:matrix/operations/addition]]
@omni.matrix:addition // to typst label (which acts as alias for heading) OR heading slug [[omni:matrix#addition]]
@omni.matrix // to file [[omni:matrix]]
@omni.linear-algebra.matrix // to file /Linear Algebra/matrix
@omni.linalg.matrix // to file /Linear Algebra/matrix (WITH AN ALIAS DEFINED IN omni.toml)
@omni.matrix[matrices] // to file with alias [[omni:matrix|matrices]]
#+END_SRC

think about how files can be linked to:
- by slug: ~@omni.my-note~ = ask db => my-note is an alias given to "12bfec" => "notes/my-note.typ"
- by absolute path: ~@omni.linalg.my-note~ = "notes/linalg/my-note"
- by absolute id: ~@omni.a5ebfe~ = go through db => "notes/my-note"
  
  WE SHOULD THEN HAVE TWO DB's: A USER MODIFIABLE ONE, AND A DYNAMIC DB BUILT FROM THE USER FACING ONE AND ALL OTHER DATA GATHERED.
** DONE perhaps look into how zettelkasten id's should work.
CLOSED: [2025-12-27 Sat 14:21]
each file (node) has it's own ID. the file might move, but it's ID remains the same.
i personally don't like links with ID's as it makes the file hard to read.
but it might be supported as a "link style" setting for the lsp, where you type the text for a link, 
and it then fills in the id with an alias.

Think about it: when someone renames (~mv~) a file, i have two problems:
that file becomes "untracked", as it is no longer present within ~nodes.toml~.
The LSP client might inform us when we move a file. (by the way snacks.rename does that in nvim)
Then we may also have a mv wrapper in the CLI that manages updating the db and updating links in other files.
(the wrapper may also use our dir_aliases..)
like ~omni mv linalg/matrix.typ math/matrix.typ~
would first of all update ~nodes.toml~, and all links of form ~path.file~ to that node.
The LSP would do the same thing. Check this out..

** TODO figure out how links are resolved
eg. Typst links are divided in four parts:
1. ~@omni~ preamble
2. ~.<filename>~ | ~.<path>.<filename>~ File
3. ~.<path_to_heading>.<heading>~ | ~:<heading>~ Heading/label (optional)
4. ~[<alias>]~ (optional)
   
Say our starting situation is:
#+begin_src
notes/
  cs/ 
    c/
      matrix.md
    discrete-math/
      proofs/
        proof-by-induction.typ
    linear-algebra/
      matrix.typ
    overview.md
  omni.toml
#+end_src

and ~db.toml~ is:
#+begin_src toml
[node.id1]
path = "cs/c/matrix.md"
kind = "file"
names = ["matrix"]

[node.id2]
path = "cs/discrete-math/proofs/proof-by-induction.typ"
kind = "file"
names = ["proof-by-induction", "induction"]

[node.id3]
path = "cs/linear-algebra/matrix.typ"
kind = "file"
names = ["matrix", "matrices"]

[node.id4]
path = "cs/overview.md"
kind = "file"
names = ["overview"]
#+end_src

So say we have a link like: ~@omni.matrix:addition[Matrix Addition]~
0. recognize that it is actually an omni link by the @omni tag. and it is of the form: ~name:heading[alias]~
1. ok, the name provided is ~matrix~. go read the .db.toml and find the id related to the name ="matrix"=
2. we have a conflict: we have two files with name "matrix". 
   that in itself is not a problem, but referring with just ~matrix~ is wrong,
   and will result in an error, with a hint suggesting to use a path.
   
Next: ~@omni.matrices~
0. the link is of form ~name~
1. now search the name ~matrices~ in nodes 
2. final resolved link =linear-algebra/matrix.typ=
   
Next: ~@omni.linalg.matrix:addition~
0. the link is of form ~path.name:heading~
1. check ~Config.dir_aliases~. ~linalg~ -> ~"cs/linear-algebra"~
2. Alright, now search the name ~matrix~ in nodes where the path *starts with* ~linear-algebra~ 
   (so it will ignore ~c~)
3. Now, what is the hierarchy of ~addition~?
   - it's typst, it might just be a label. Is it? yes, just return ~addition~
4. final resolved link =linear-algebra/matrix.typ#addition=
   
Next: ~@omni.cs.discrete-math.proof-by-induction~
0. the link is of form ~path.name~
1. ~cs~ and ~discrete-math~ are not aliases, so the path resolves to ~cs/discrete-math~
2. find the node in the db with name ~proof-by-induction~ where path *starts with* ~cs/discrete-math~
3. final resolved link =cs/discrete-math/proofs/proof-by-induction=
   
Next: ~@omni-id.id2~
0. the link is of form ~id~
1. final resolved link =cs/c/matrix.md=
   
Next: ~@omni.dima.proofs.induction:other.strong-induction~ \equiv ~[[omni:dima/proofs/induction#other#strong-induction]]~
0. the link is of form ~path.name:heading_path.heading~
1. check ~Config.dir_aliases~. ~dima~ -> ~"cs/discrete-math"~
2. append ~proofs~ to the dir to get ~cs/discrete-math/proofs~
3. Alright, now search the name ~induction~ in nodes where the path *starts with* ~cs/discrete-math/proofs~ 
4. now for the heading path. it's ~#other#strong-induction~. 
   in typst, you should really use labels for this. but this would also match
   #+begin_src typ
   = Other <other>
   == Strong Induction <strong>
   #+end_src
   But it wuld be best to use ~#strong~ or ~#other#strong~.
   The header paths are mostly for obsidian wikilinks as those support it.
   Pretty much in typst, headings correspond either to labels or a slug-ized version of the real heading.
   OR we could force every heading to have a label...
5. final resolved link =cs/discrete-math/proofs/proof-by-induction.typ#other#strong-induction=
   and this is kind of what it would look like internally if it had an alias:
   #+begin_src toml
  from = "id3"
  to = "id2"
  heading_path = "#other#strong-induction"
  alias = "prove by strong induction"
   #+end_src

FINAL STEP:
all links must be normalized before using in html.
1. Check if the link resolves to any location.
   - Yes -> proceed
   - No  -> stop here and display a gray link that points to nothing.
2. url's want a single ~#id~ hash thing. so ~#operations#addition~ becomes ~#addition~
   (KEEP IN MIND: if we have two different headings called addition, the html link will point to the first one it finds.
   no big deal, that's what it does in obsidian too. we could also throw an error in that case.)
** DONE consider abandoning the id-ization for headings, can complicate things a lot
CLOSED: [2025-12-26 Fri 21:15]
We also need to keep in mind how org-roam works. there you can assign an ID any "subtree" 
but that's something we only need to keep in mind for building the links.toml. 
which in that case we might ask org-roam itself for it's internal links
** TODO are we sure that we need the ~heading_path.heading~?
because in typst we can just use labels for this.
but it might be useful for other formats, so i guess we should keep it?
** DONE look into WASM for writing a function for resolving links that typst can use too
CLOSED: [2025-12-28 Sun 13:49]
** TODO How to gather links
- [ ] Typst
    - [ ] Normalize at typst-compile time AND add links as #metadata (with WASM)
    - [ ] Gather at omni-build time (with typst query)
- [ ] Markdown
    - [ ] Normalize and gather at omni-build time 
        - [ ] via a markdown-rs extension 
        - [ ] OR by inspecting the AST with the default wiki links extension
